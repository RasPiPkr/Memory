When you start playing the memory game it will create a csv file to keep track of the scores for next time and the file will be where your playing the game file.

Playing:
--------
Select your difficulty grid from the drop down menu called game.

Click on a box it will turn green and reveal a number, then click on another box and that too will turn green but if the numbers match they will turn yellow. If no match they will back to original state. Keep going until you fill the grid and the timer will stop and that will be your score.
